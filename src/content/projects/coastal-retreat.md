## The Vision

Drawing inspiration from the North Sea coastline, this residence celebrates the interplay of light and nature.

## Our Approach

We incorporated natural materials that echo the coastal environment—weathered woods, sandy neutrals, and ocean-inspired accents. Large windows blur the boundary between interior and exterior.

## The Result

A home that breathes with its surroundings, changing character with the seasons and the light.
