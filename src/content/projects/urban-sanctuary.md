## The Vision

In the heart of Rotterdam, we created an urban sanctuary that contrasts the city's industrial heritage with refined, calming interiors.

## Our Approach

The design emphasizes negative space and intentional simplicity. Each element earns its place, creating an environment where the mind can rest.

## The Result

A sophisticated retreat that proves urban living and tranquility can coexist beautifully.
